# **Car Sales Price Prediction using ANN**  

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict car purchase amounts based on customer demographics and financial data. The model is trained on historical data and saved for future use.

## **📌 Features**
✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and removes unnecessary columns.  
✅ **ANN Model**: A deep learning model with multiple layers to improve accuracy.  
✅ **Model Saving & Loading**: Saves the trained model and scaler for future predictions.  
✅ **Separate Prediction File**: Allows making predictions without retraining the model.

## **📂 File Structure**
```
📂 Car-Sales-Prediction
 ├── car_purchasing.csv         # Dataset (Make sure it's in the same directory)
 ├── train_model.py             # Train the ANN model and save it
 ├── predict_model.py           # Load the trained model & predict car purchase amount
 ├── car_sales_model.h5         # Saved ANN model (generated after training)
 ├── scaler.pkl                 # Saved scaler for normalizing input data
 ├── README.md                  # Project documentation

## **🛠️ Setup & Installation**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn joblib
```

### **2️⃣ Train the Model**
Run the training script to build and save the model:
```bash
python train_model.py
```
🔹 This will generate:
- `car_sales_model.h5` (Trained model)
- `scaler.pkl` (Scaler for normalizing input data)

### **3️⃣ Make Predictions**
Use the saved model to predict car purchase amounts:
```bash
python predict_model.py
```
You can modify `predict_model.py` to input different customer details.

## **🔮 Example Prediction**
If a customer has:
- Gender: **Male (1)**
- Age: **55**
- Annual Salary: **70,000**
- Credit Card Debt: **10,000**
- Net Worth: **500,000**

The script will output:
```
Predicted Car Purchase Amount: 57993.62
```

## **📊 Business Insights: How This Helps Marketing Strategies**
This model helps businesses **optimize their marketing strategies** by:  
✅ **Targeting High-Potential Customers**: Identifies customers likely to purchase expensive cars.  
✅ **Segmenting Customers**: Groups customers based on income, age, and financial stability.  
✅ **Optimizing Advertising Spend**: Focuses on high-net-worth individuals for luxury car ads.  
✅ **Personalized Offers**: Provides customized discounts based on predicted purchase amounts.

## **📢 Future Improvements**
🔹 Implement more advanced deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs or RNNs)  
🔹 Integrate real-time customer data for dynamic predictions  
🔹 Deploy as a web API for easy access
